# Todo List

## Bugs

1.  `<leader>ff` does not focus the floating search window when buffers are open. The cursor remains in the current buffer.
2.  `<leader>ld` keybinding is not working.
3.  `<leader>lr` keybinding is not working.

*Note: All issues appeared after upgrading Neovim from v0.10 to v0.11.*
